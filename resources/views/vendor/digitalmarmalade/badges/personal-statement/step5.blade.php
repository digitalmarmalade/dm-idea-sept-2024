        <h2>Correct!</h2>
        <p>Too short, too vague in terms of the ‘as long as I can remember’ element, no demonstration of critical thinking – where does it really explore your interest in art, or showcase your ability or even stand out from the crowd? Projects a serious lack of effort.</p>

        <p>Confusing to the reader, as the statement talks in the first and third person. A better example would be:</p>
        <p>A recent media communications graduate with a 2:1 honours degree from the University of Huddersfield, I would like to secure a graduate media analyst position to use and further develop my qualitative research and team working skills. I am hoping to gain experience working in a dynamic and fast-paced environment.

        <p>After finishing my HND in Computer Science at University of Lancashire, I plan to move onto a degree at one of the chosen universities. I plan to enter that degree programme in the Final Year (Year 3) but would also settle for year 2.</p>

      <div class="task-4-feedback feedback-fail feedback-fail-5">
        <h2>Correct!</h2>
        <p>Too sparse – no info about what the 'chosen universities' are; no real interest for the subject and worst of all – the applicant has made a statement about admission eligibility which is too forceful (and probably not even correct) which will only serve to annoy admissions staff. This was a real application to the University of Reading.</p>

        <p>To whom ever it might concern,</p>
        <p>I considered myself to that of a pack of wolves , each wolf a characteristic of my own whether it was my past, present future or yet devided i was. There was no leader for the pack, but luckily this past summer i went to this program in Oxford called the Oxford Tradition, that truley changed my life. I studied there Politics and economics and through that i learnt where my future lies. In an instant I knew that i can help people with what icould learn in the future, and it is the future that i must change for the better of course.</p>

        <h2>Correct!</h2>
        <p>Do we really need to explain? Another true application to the University of Reading, an example of a very poor personal statement with lack of accurate detail, too generic, poor grammar – and it's not clear how being a pack of wolves really adds to their application.</p>
