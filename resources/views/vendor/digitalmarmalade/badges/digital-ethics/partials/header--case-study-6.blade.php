            <h2>Global online retailer</h2>
            <p>A global online retailer needs to provide support for its customers so support staff sometimes need access to the customer’s data to address their requests for help.</p>
            <p>In this organisation, employees are screened with background checks before they start their jobs and access to customer data is controlled via a least-privilege policy, which means that staff are given the minimum levels of access, or permissions needed to perform their duties. Employees are trained on security and privacy regularly and they practise the organisation’s incident response plan at least annually.</p>
