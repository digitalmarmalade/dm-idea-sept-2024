            <h2>Digitisation of welfare services</h2>
            <p>As part of their ongoing efforts to deliver welfare services more effectively and efficiently, a government decided to digitise the process completely. This means that people can only make their claims for support using an online system. The online system determines the amount of financial support that the person can receive (which may differ from one month to the next if they earn a different amount, or if their circumstances change) and processes payment automatically.</p>
