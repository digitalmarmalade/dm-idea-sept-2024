            <h2>Machine learning algorithm for university recruitment</h2>
            <p>A university introduced a machine learning algorithm to select students in the initial screening stage to help accelerate the recruitment process. The algorithm was designed based on the criteria of the universityâ€™s most successful students since it started. Until recently, this was a male-only university. As a result, the number of non-male candidates shortlisted by the algorithm were very low.</p>
