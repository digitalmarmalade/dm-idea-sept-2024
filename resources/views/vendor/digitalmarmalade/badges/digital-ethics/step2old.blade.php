                        <p>The creation and use of digital products, tools and services can bring about many ethical
                            dilemmas that can potentially impact individuals, whole communities, and the world.</p>

                    <p>While digital innovation offers many benefits, there are also pitfalls that we must be aware of
                        and try to avoid. As you learn about digital ethics and look at situations through an ethical
                        lens, you will realise that there is also a big grey area where there may not be a clear right
                        or wrong answer.</p>
                    <p>Next, you will explore six different examples of digital innovation.</p>
                    <p>Your task is to carefully consider the impact (both positive and negative) of each one, and how
                        it could affect individuals, society, or the world.</p>
