            UNDP&rsquo;s 2001 Human Development Report and, more recently, the World Bank&rsquo;s 2016 World Development Report evaluated the potential of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) to accelerate human development.

            <p>The <strong>Information Communication Technologies (ICT)</strong> play an important role in fostering local, national and global food security and inclusive rural development by enhancing production and productivity, lowering operating costs, facilitating access to markets, information, credit, and capacity-building, among other things. In fact, over recent decades, we&rsquo;ve seen the socioeconomic benefits of, for example, mobile telephony in improving the lives of many poor rural people.  </p>

          <div class="inner-col">
            <p>We&rsquo;ve seen how, thanks to mobile phones, people who previously were both socially and economically excluded are now actively participating in the economy.

            After just one agricultural season, they agreed there had been considerable impact on their access to markets, their production, and their incomes. For an initial investment of USD 200,000, the project’s activities contributed to a gross increase in income of participants of more than USD 1.8 million. 
            </p>

            <p>
            In Tanzania, for example, an IFAD-supported project provided rural women and men with information via mobile phones, the Internet and email while giving them access to other key people in the market chain, including processors, traders and consumers.

        <p>
          One way that technology can help bridge the gender gap is to teach digital skills to more women across the whole globe. <strong>iamtheCODE</strong>, who work with governments from across the world, are one of the social enterprises making a tangible, practical difference.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, one of the initiatives <strong>iamtheCODE</strong> provides is highly specialised training to women in a safe space, which in turns opens up job opportunities which were previously not accessible. They deliver critical coding skills in digital clubs, which can be delivered in marginalised areas as diverse as the Favelas in Rio de Janeiro to areas of need in the UK, and the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. 
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>iamtheCODE</strong> also organizes hackathons as practical opportunities to use the skills learnt to make real life solutions.

                Providing young women with coding skills empowers them to tackle many goals. Under goal 13 – Climate action, a group from Kenya were able to develop and work on a drone project that protects their local forest - a great example of providing quality education to bridge the gender gap whilst allowing young minds to connect the dots, and help us all reach our targets across all the goals.</p>
                <p>
                  iamtheCODE also run mentorship programs as their third strand of activities which ensure as many young women and girls as possible become confident with technology.

            SDG 6 commits the UN to ensuring the <strong>availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all</strong>, including an end to open <a class="tooltip" href="#">defecation<span>The elimination of solid waste matter from the digestive system.</span></a>, by 2030.
          </p>
          <p>
          <p>
            Technology will play a pivotal role in achieving this ambitious goal, not just in terms of engineering technology in the delivery and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities and systems (such as taps, toilets and pipework), but also in the more extensive use of ICTs in helping us to manage water itself – the resource on which sanitation and hygiene depend.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p>
            Good governance, based on reliable information gathered by and shared through ICTs, is essential to manage uncertainty and reduce the risks of over-exploitation and pollution of water resources and to extend and maintain sanitation systems that are proven to massively reduce the spread of disease.
          </p>
          <p>Without an integrated, data-driven approach to water and sanitation that takes account of the needs of the whole economy and protects the environment, we risk jeopardizing the success of the SDGs as a whole.
