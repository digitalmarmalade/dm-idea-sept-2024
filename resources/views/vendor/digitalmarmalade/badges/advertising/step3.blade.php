        <p>Advertising can be categorised in lots of different ways. in this section we will be looking at advertising based on traditional types of media used to transmit a message. Let’s learn now a bit more about the advantages and disadvantages of each of these mediums.</p>

        <p>We will describe below four types of media advertising and you are expected to select the alternative that best matches the description.</p>

                <p>Magazines are usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published, and contains a variety of content.  They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three. </p>

                <p>A type of advert specific to this media are advertorials. They basically combine the benefits of traditional print ads with feature articles written by a news reporter. </p>

                        <li>Many people travel the same route repeatedly, such as with their commute to work each day. This means that they'll see your billboard regularly, which makes it more likely to stick in their minds.</li>
                        <li>You can place your billboard advertisement wherever you feel it will have the most impact. This can be a big advantage when you have a business which relates in location to the billboard.</li>

                    <li>You'll need to keep your messages short and to the point (on average, a person will see your billboard for about two to three seconds). Billboards do better when they focus more on images than on text since they are often seen by people driving by.</li>
                    <li>Billboard companies often have businesses enter into contracts that involve long-term commitments. Mainly, this is because it takes a lot of time, energy and money to constantly change billboard ads.</li>

                <ul class="pro-or-con-list">
                    <li>Because radio listeners are spread over many stations, you may have to advertise simultaneously on several stations to reach your target audience.</li>
                    <li>Listeners cannot go back to your ads to go over important points.</li>
                    <li>Ads are an interruption in the entertainment. Because of this, a radio ad may require multiple exposure to break through the listener’s “tune-out” factor and ensure message retention.</li>
                    <li>Radio is a background medium. Most listeners are doing something else while listening, which means that your ad has to work hard to get their attention.</li>
