                <li><span>ABC</span>Always Be Closing , a theory where everything the sale person says is geared to getting the sale.</li>

                <li><span>Account Executive</span>Usually a person who has several customers (accounts) and looks after them trying to grow them into bigger accounts.</li>

                <li><span>Analytics</span>Studying data (which usually comes from website/social media activity, but can also extend to coupon redemption) to try to identify patterns which can then be turned into strategy and action to help sales.</li>

                <li><span>Annual Recurring Revenue</span>Sales that happen every year - such as an annual subscription.</li>
                                                                                      <li><span>Average Contract Value (ACV)</span>The average amount of money you receive from a single customer over a fixed period - could be per day, week, month or year.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div tabindex="0">
            <button>B</button>
            <div class="tab">
              <ul>
                <li><span>Benefit</span>The value of the product/service that the user experiences – this is different to a feature.</li>

                <li><span>Business-to-Business(B2B)</span>A business that markets – or sells – to other businesses only.</li>

                <li><span>Business-to-Consumer(B2C)</span>A business that markets and sells to the public (consumers).</li>

                <li><span>Buyer</span>The person (or company) that actually buys the product – not to be confused with the consumer (who is the person who uses the product).</li>
                                                                                      <li><span>Buyer Behavior</span>How a person decides to buy the product – often influenced by the consumer's wants, desires and background.</li>
                                                                                      <li><span>Buyer Persona</span>A way to describe your typical customer – usually based on research and analytics. Helps to target better leads.</li>

                <li><span>Buying Process/Cycle</span>Potential customers will often give subtle signals suggesting they are ready to buy – for example asking about when it will be delivered. Pay attention to these signs, as they are often missed, but critical in securing that sale.</li>

              </ul>

                <li><span>Customer</span>Someone who buys your product - sometimes called a client.</li>

                <li><span>Customer Acquisition Cost(CAC)</span>The amount of money it takes to acquire a new customer – this is worked out by (Money + Time Spent)/Number of New customers – for example £2,000 spend during the month generated 100 new customers meaning the CAC was £20 for the month.</li>

                <li><span>Customer Loyalty</span>When a customer repeatedly buys the same product.</li>

                <li><span>Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</span>A way to manage the information you hold on a customer.
