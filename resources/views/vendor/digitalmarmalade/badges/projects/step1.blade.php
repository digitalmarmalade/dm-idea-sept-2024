            <p class="come-in">Well, the easiest way to define it is as a unique task which has a definite beginning and end. Projects tend to be quite complex, made up of lots of subtasks and often require lots of people, materials and money to complete them.</p>

                    <p>No. A project has a definite beginning and end. Refuelling the car is a task that needs to be repeated indefinitely.</p>

                    <p>No. Although a number of people are involved, they are tasks for individuals and are carried out independently.</p>

                    <p>No. This has a definite beginning and end but isnâ€™t very complex, so would count as a task rather than a project.</p>

                    <p>The team has entered a big race. The car needs to be checked, fuelled and cleaned. Parts need to be ordered and fitted to the engine. The driver needs to learn the course and the paperwork needs to be correctly submitted. This must all happen by the last Saturday before the race. Is this a project?</p>

                    <p>Yes. Completing the race requires different people to complete a number of tasks (subtasks of the project), some of which must be completed before others can start. This means that tasks must be ordered in the most efficient way which can be complex. Race day means there is a definite end date.</p>
