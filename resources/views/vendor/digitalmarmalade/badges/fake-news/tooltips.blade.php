      Machine learning (ML) is a <strong>type of artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> 
      that allows software applications to become more accurate at 
      predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. 
      Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new 
      output values.

      <strong>Deep learning</strong> is a class of <strong>machine learning</strong> 
      algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level 
      features from the raw input.
