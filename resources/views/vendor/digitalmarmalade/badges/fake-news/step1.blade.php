        Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that is inspired by the way a human brain processes information. This type of model uses a <span class="tooltipster jsTooltip" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip13_content">neural network</span> to train and improve itself to perform tasks by processing huge amounts of data within seconds. Neural networks have multiple layers which progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input.
