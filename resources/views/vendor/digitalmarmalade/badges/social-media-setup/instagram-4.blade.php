                    <p>When you share a photo on Instagram, regardless of whether you're using Instagram for iOS or Android, Instagram makes sure to upload it at the best quality resolution possible (up to a width of 1080 pixels).</p>
                    <p>When you share a photo that has a width between 320 and 1080 pixels, Instagram keeps that photo at its original resolution as long as the photo's aspect ratio is between 1.91:1 and 4:5 (a height between 566 and 1350 pixels with a width of 1080 pixels). </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col">
                    <p>If the aspect ratio of your photo isn't supported, it will be cropped to fit a supported ratio. If you share a photo at a lower resolution, Instagram enlarges it to a width of 320 pixels. If you share a photo at a higher resolution, Instagram shrinks it down to a width of 1080 pixels.</p>
                    <p>If you want to make sure that your photo is shared with a width of 1080 pixels, follow the tips below:</p>
