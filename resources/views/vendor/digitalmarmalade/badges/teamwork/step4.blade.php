       <p>Once the team structures are in place it is time to get on with the teamwork itself. This is often in the form of a project - a one off team effort to achieve a goal. So how do we do this? One easy way is to use the following steps:</p>

           <p>What is it you are trying to achieve? Break this down into specifics. For example, build a new app to find the latest music releases, delivered in 2 months, available on all major phone operating systems.</p>

           <p>Work out what the goal means in terms of your team and what they will need to do when, again make this as specific as possible so you can produce a detailed plan which you will then monitor.</p>
